Dear Bill,
Our sincerest thanks for your contribution to our cause. Your donation of $774,464 will undoubtably be
an integral part of our success in the coming year. We expect it to be a difficult road ahead,
but we truly derive strength from, and are encouraged by the outpouring of generosity from donors
like yourself. Feel free to subscribe to our mailing list, or check out our blog to follow our
progress, and to see your dollars in action. Expect a gift from us in the mail soon- just a
small token of our gratitude, and a way to show others your continued support of our efforts.
Thank you again, from all of us here.
