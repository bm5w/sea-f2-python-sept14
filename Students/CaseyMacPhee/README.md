> I'm looking to take my novice programming skills to the next level, in order to hold a position on a team where I'm involved in the natural sciences. I just got my open water diver certification, which I see as a fun stepping stone on the way towards further understanding the interaction and complexity of the biological world. I'm passionate about conservation, and finding the proper solutions to difficult problems related to our region's sustainability. I'm particularly interested in aquaculture practices, and their affect on the natural ecosystem. This industry has much to learn, and has a long way to go in order to meet consumer demands, while limiting the negative externalities it undoubtably produces. Along with antiquated processes, and methodologies that aren't consistent with our current understanding of proper practice, comes a great potential for change. It's clear to see a state unbalance between consumption, and conservation but with that comes a equal amount of opportunity, which is in large part why I'm excited to get involved. It's my goal to reach a level of competency so I may begin to wrestle with these critical solutions to problemes previously unanswered.
