I am a tech recruiter ready to cross over. I have a bachelors degree in Math from the UW, and I'm ready to finally be utilizing what I went to school for. I would love to have a career as a programmer and be constantly doing something new. There are a few projects I would like to tackle to put out into the world myself, but I first have to develop the necessary skills in order to achieve that. Thus, here I am. 

I really look forward to be learning with the instructors, TAs, and everyone else!
