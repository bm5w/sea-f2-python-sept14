# About me

My name is Charlie, I'm 26 and graduated from the University of Oregon with degrees in philosophy and math. My passion is philosophy, and part of me wishes I had pursued graduate school after earning my bachelor's, but I have discovered that I love to write code, and it is a lucrative hobby. My life philosophy is that one has a limited amount of temporal capitol--i.e. you can only do so much with your time--so it is best to pick a handful of things (hobbies/skills) to focus on and not fritter your time on much else. One can be the best at only one thing, pretty good at a handful of things, or mediocre at many things. I prefer the second option.
